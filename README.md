## Introduction
Vehicle theft remains a significant concern in New Zealand, impacting individuals and communities. This report analyzes the available data to identify trends, hotspots, and demographics related to vehicle theft incidents. The goal is to provide actionable insights for law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and the public.

## Data Sources
- [New Zealand Police Crime Statistics](https://www.police.govt.nz)
- [Open Data Portal](https://data.govt.nz)

## Key Findings
- **Trends Over Time:** Analysis of theft incidents over the past decade.
- **Geographical Distribution:** Identification of high-risk areas for vehicle theft.
- **Demographic Insights:** Understanding victim and offender profiles.
- **Prevention Strategies:** Recommendations based on data trends.

## Methodology
The analysis of vehicle thefts in New Zealand was conducted using Excel Power Query and Power BI. The steps involved in the methodology are detailed below:

### Tools Used
- **Excel Power Query:** For data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
- **Power BI:** For data visualization and reporting.

### Steps Involved

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Imported data from various sources, including CSV files and online databases, using Power Query to gather all relevant vehicle theft statistics.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Utilized Power Query to clean the dataset by:
     - Removing duplicates and irrelevant columns.
     - Filtering out incomplete records.
     - Transforming data types for consistency (e.g., dates, numerical values).
     - Creating new calculated columns (e.g., year of theft, theft rate per region).

3. **Data Transformation:**
   - Applied various transformations in Power Query, such as:
     - Merging datasets to create a comprehensive view of vehicle thefts.
     - Grouping data by key attributes (e.g., region, month) to summarize theft incidents.
     - Pivoting and unpivoting tables to facilitate analysis.

4. **Data Analysis:**
   - Loaded the cleaned and transformed data into Power BI for further analysis.
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns in vehicle theft incidents over time and across different regions.

5. **Data Visualization:**
   - Created interactive dashboards in Power BI, including:
     - Time series charts to visualize theft trends over the years.
     - Heatmaps to identify high-risk areas for vehicle theft.
     - Bar charts and pie charts to present demographic insights of victims and offenders.

6. **Reporting:**
   - Compiled the visualizations into a comprehensive Power BI report, allowing stakeholders to interact with the data and derive insights.
   - Provided key takeaways and actionable recommendations based on the analysis and visualizations.

### Final Output
The final output of the analysis includes a detailed Power BI dashboard that presents the findings in a visually appealing manner, making it easy for law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and the public to understand vehicle theft trends and implement effective prevention strategies.
